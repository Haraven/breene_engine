### Notes
All of the project dependencies are already included. You can simply clone the project, and run it, to see the current feature that I am working on implementing, or have just finished implementing. **For now, run the application in _Release x64_ configuration mode. For some reason, running in debug mode causes low framerate, and black textures. Assumping it's caused by my Assimp build being in release mode. Will look into it.**

<br>
Expect bugs. You are free to report them, and I will try to address them ASAP.

Also expect regular updates over the duration of the summer. Additionally, I'm hoping to create a 2D Breakout game using this engine, in a couple of months. Fingers crossed!
