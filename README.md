### Notes
All of the project dependencies are already included. You can simply clone the project, and run it, to see the current feature that I am working on implementing, or have just finished implementing. Also, expect bugs. You are free to report them, and I will try to address them ASAP.

Expect regular updates over the duration of the summer. I also hope to create a 2D Breakout game using this engine, in a couple of months. Fingers crossed!
